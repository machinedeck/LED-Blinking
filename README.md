# LED Blinking
_Last Update: November 12, 2025_

## Background
After my previous mock keypad project, I have become more excited to do a lot of similar projects involving circuitry and algorithm development in Python and Arduino/C++. I realized that Arduino UNO had a built-in LED, and I would like to extend the keypad project to control the LED blinking time. However, I did not want to complicate things much since I was trying new things. But I'd like to keep it more exciting, so I decided to build an LED blinking system where the blinking rate would be controlled by sending signals from a Python UI.
